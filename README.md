# NestJs Deno test

This is a vanilla nestjs project generated by the nestjs cli version 10.3.2.

## Changes
The goal of this project is to get as close as possible to having the project run with Deno. For this, the following changes have been made.

- app.controller.spec.ts was renamed to app.controller.test.ts
- app.controller.test.ts now has a unit test according to Deno.test
- All imports have .ts postfixed to them to prevent sloppy imports warning.
- Deno initialize workspace was run to add the settings.json.
- Deno init was run to add a deno.json
- "experimentalDecorators": true was added to compilerOptions in deno.json
